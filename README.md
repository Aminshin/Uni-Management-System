# Uni Management System For Chamran Uni

This is a management system for the education affairs of a university.
In this system, you can have information such as information about professors, students, course offerings, unit selection programs, student grades, and the average grade point average of a student's course, and ranking, etc.
This project is written in Python, and its code-first approach makes it much smoother and easier to create its database structure.
In this project, SQLite 3 and SQL Alchemy were used to design the database structure.
This project was created entirely individually and its credits are in my possession.
